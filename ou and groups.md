# Goal
- Build an OU and group structure in Active Directory to organize users, computers, and manage permissions across the lab.

## OU Structure
- Created a basic but scalable  OU hierarchy to simulate department-based organization.
- This structure supports user/group delegation, GPO targeting, and file server integration later.
- Moved previously created users to their respective department OUs:
  - John Smith was moved to the Sales OU.
  - Jane Doe was moved to the IT OU.
