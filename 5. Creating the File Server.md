### Share and Set Permissions
- HR_ReadOnly = Read on HR
- HR_FullAccess = Modify on HR
- Similar for Sales & IT groups
- Shared each folder via File Explorer:
    - Share name matches folder name (\\\FS-1\HR)

### Test Access from Clients
- Logged in as different users  on lab PCs
- Verified:
  - Correct network drive access
  - Read-only vs full access applied properly
  - Public share accessible by all users
