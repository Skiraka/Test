# Goal
- Set up a Micrisoft Endpoint Configuration Manager server and deploy an application to a client using the Configuration Manager.

---

## Configuration Steps
- Created a new Windows Server 2022 virtual machine and installed the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.
- Installed the prerequisites on the same server for simplicity.
- The Site Code was named 'LAB'.
- Created a new Windows 10 client virtual machine 'PC-10' for this lab to function as the client as PC-1 and PC-2 will be managed through Microsoft Intune in later labs.
- Joined PC-10 to the domain.

 ---

## Installing the Client
- Pushed the client install to PC-10 from the MECM Console.
- Confirmed PC-10 now has the Software Center installed and working.

- Now that PC-10 has the Software Center client installed I wanted to verify that I could actually push software through the Configuration Manager.
- Downloaded 7zip (7z2500-x64.msi) into the lab source share: \\CM-1\ECM_Sources\Applications\7Zip
- In the MECM console:
  - Software Library > Applications
  - Created a new application using the MSI wizard
  - Application Name: 7-Zip 25.00 (x64 edition)

 ---

## Deploying the Application
- Right-clicked 7-Zip > Deploy
  - Selected All Systems as the target collection (includes PC-10)
  - Made availability immediate.

---

## Client Software Center Verification
- On PC-10:
  - Opened Software Center
  - 7-Zip was available under Applications
  - Clicked Install â†’ installation succeeded
  - Confirmed presence of 7-Zip under Start Menu and Apps & Features

## Notes
- Successfully demonstrated core Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager functionality.
- From here, the lab will pivot to Microsoft Intune to explore cloud-native management scenarios.
