## Test Access from Clients
- Logged into test lab PCs as users from HR, Sales, and IT groups.
- Accessed shares via `\\FS-1\HR`.
- Verified the following:
  - Users with ReadOnly groups could access but not modify files.
  - Users with FullAccess groups could create, edit, and delete files.
  - The `Public` share was accessible and writable by all authenticated users.
